What is the ELBO?

1. A method to determine the number of clusters.
2. **A training objective in variational inference.**
3. The reconstruction errors in Variational Auto Encoders.

What is a KL-divergence?

1. **A measure to determine the difference between two probability distributions.**
2. It is the entropy of one probabilitiy distribution given the likelihood of the other.
3. It is a predictor that outputs whether a distribution diverges at some point in the support.
4. I do not know.

What does $\mathcal{N}(x;\mu,\sigma^2)$ refer to?

1. It means that $x$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
2. It is a placeholder for a Gaussian's probability density function with known parameters.
3. **Both, 1) and 2).**
4. Neigher of the above.
5. I do not know.

What is variational inference?

1. Using variations of a probability distribution to compute an expectation.
2. A special form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo.
3. **Using a tractable distribution to approximate an intractable one.**
4. I do not know.

What is a UNet?

1. A special fishing device that lets fishes in to one end but not the other.
2. A special form of CNN.
3. **A NN that samples its inputs down and then up again.**
4. I do not know.

What is a posterior?

1. Something that is observed aposteriori, i.e., after it happend.
2. The probability of the data given the paramters.
3. The joint distribution of an variable that is immediatly observable and one, that is revealed later.
4. **The probability of the parameters given the evidence.**
